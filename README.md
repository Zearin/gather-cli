# gather-cli

<!-- README -->

This project is the successor to read2text, which was a Python based tool that used Arc90 Readability and html2text to convert web urls to Markdown documents, ready to store in your notes.

This version is Swift-based and compiled as a binary that doesn't require Python or any other processor to run. It has more options, better parsing, and should be an all-around useful tool, easy to incorporate into almost any project.

The code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ttscoff/gather-cli). It's built as a Swift Package and can be compiled using the `swift` command line tool. I'm just learning Swift, so I guarantee there's a lot of stupidity in the code. If you dig in, feel free to kindly point out my errors.
